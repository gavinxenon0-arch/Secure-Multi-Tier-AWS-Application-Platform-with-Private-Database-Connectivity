# Evidence Pack

## Project

**Secure Multi-Tier AWS Application Platform with Private Database Connectivity**

## Purpose

This evidence pack documents the **final working state** of the AWS infrastructure and application stack.

It proves that the project was deployed, validated, and operational across the following layers:

- AWS networking
- VPC peering
- private routing
- security groups
- ECS on EC2
- standalone EC2 application hosting
- Application Load Balancers
- private RDS MySQL connectivity
- Terraform-based deployment

```

The architecture uses public Application Load Balancers as the entry points while keeping application workloads and the database in private subnets. The application layers connect to the private RDS database through VPC peering and controlled security group rules.

# 2. Networking Evidence

## VPC List

This screenshot shows the VPCs used in the project.

Expected VPC layout:

| VPC | Purpose | CIDR |
|---|---|---|
| Project 1 VPC | ECS on EC2 application workload | `10.40.0.0/16` |
| Project 2 VPC | Private RDS database hub | `10.80.0.0/16` |
| Project 3 VPC | Standalone EC2 application workload | `10.120.0.0/16` |

![VPC List](./02-networking/vpc-list.png)

## Project 1 Private Route Table

This screenshot shows the private route table for the ECS application VPC.

Expected routing behavior:

```text
Project 1 private subnet
  → Project 2 database VPC through VPC peering
  → Internet-bound traffic through NAT Gateway
```

![Project 1 Private Route Table](./02-networking/project1-private-route-table.png)

---

## Project 2 Private Route Table

This screenshot shows the private route table for the database VPC.

Expected routing behavior:

```text
Project 2 database VPC
  → Project 1 ECS VPC through VPC peering
  → Project 3 EC2 app VPC through VPC peering
```

This return routing is required so RDS can respond to application traffic from both application VPCs.

![Project 2 Private Route Table](./02-networking/project2-private-route-table.png)

---

## Project 3 Private Route Table

This screenshot shows the private route table for the standalone EC2 application VPC.

![EC2 App Security Group](./03-security/ec2-app-security-group.png)

---

## Database Security Group

This screenshot shows the security group attached to the private RDS MySQL database.

Expected behavior:

```

The database should not allow broad public access in the final working state.

# Evidence Summary

This evidence pack confirms that the project reached a working final state.

The completed architecture demonstrates:

- public ALB access to private application workloads
- ECS on EC2 containerized deployment
- standalone EC2 application deployment
- private RDS MySQL database connectivity
- VPC peering between application and database networks
- security group-controlled database access
- SSM-based private instance access
- Terraform-managed infrastructure deployment
- working application validation through `/health` and `/dbcheck`

The key proof point is that both application paths can reach the private RDS database successfully without exposing the database publicly.

```text
ECS App → VPC Peering → RDS MySQL = Working
EC2 App → VPC Peering → RDS MySQL = Working
```
